User Manual
Our application is a Craigslist-like application  for students. When they open the application, they will receive instructions on how to work the application. Once they have finished the mini tutorial, they will be prompted to a Google sign in, in which their names and emails are populated into a profile page. Users are free to change their names and make their names. Once they make the account, they are prompt to a Buy and Sell page where they are able to make the transactions.
